# Upate notes for version 0.1.1

* Added a function to validate the hyper-parameters via BIC or cross-validation.
* Added a generic printing and plotting function for the cross-validation results.
* Added a Cholesky factor condition check in ``twoStepSDFM()`` to handle ill-behaved matrices.
* Changed the initial states of the Kalman filter for it to run more smoothly.
* Several minor bug fixes.
